Use this when you need to understand what code elements exist inside a package,
prepare to find references, or identify which symbols might be renamed.`,

Use this when you need to locate every place where a type, function, or variable is used,
for example before renaming or refactoring.`,

Use this when you need to jump to or confirm the exact definition of an identifier.`,
